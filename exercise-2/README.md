# Exercise-2

In this exercise, you'll practice working with more complex data from
the Spotify API. To better understand these endpoints, see
<https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/endpoint-reference/>.

As in previous exercises, you should fork and clone this repository,
follow the instructions in `exercise.R` file, then `add` and `commit`
your changes so that you can `push` them back up to Github.
